# Exclusive RG-A Momentum Corrections
Momentum Corrections developed using exclusive pion reactions.


# Plans:
1) Add more README files for side notes (like this)
2) Split the final jupyter notebook into two files (one for ∆P histograms and one for the Missing Mass histograms)
3) Add π0 files (from home directory) to this github (if their size allows)
4) Include a "Images" section on github?

## Update Notes:

### On 8-10-2022:
#### As of 8:00 pm
* Edited the jupyter notebook file and the python script (cleaned up old/outdated code)
    * python code less effected than the jupyter notebook
* Reran all code (final output files not available due to size)
#### As of 11:00 am:
* Added all (existing) files to this github
    * More may come/change as updates are made
* Some files may not work properly due to changes to file location (work being done to localize the code to work in any directory)
